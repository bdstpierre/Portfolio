# Portfolio
## Description
This is a webpage to highlight my work as a web developer.  This page will be updated as my number of projects grow.

# To Do
- [ ] Include developers name, recent photo and links to sections about them
- [ ] Scroll to the appropriate section when links are clicked
- [ ] Include sections with titled images of the developer's applications
- [ ] The first application's image should be larger than the other applications
- [ ] Clicking on the imageof the application should take the user to the deployed application
- [ ] The site needs to have a responsive layout (adapts to the viewport)

## Installation
This project is just a simple one-page website with accompanying assests of a style.css file and some image files.  It should work fine if you copy all the files and file structure to your server.
